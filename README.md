# Welcome to AdventJS Solutions!

  

Hi dev, in this repository you will find the best solutions I could develop for the **[AdventJS ](https://adventjs.dev/)** challenges.

  

In each folder you will find a README file where the challenge is explained (in english and spanish) and the solution in a js file.

  

For the development I used the **[RunJS](https://runjs.app/)** (js playground) and all of them were tested and approved by the AdventJS website.

**Challenges 19/25 completed!!**

>  **Note:** The original explanations are written in Spanish but I will do my best to translate them.ğŸ˜–
