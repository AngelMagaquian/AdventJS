Lara Eloft has found some elven remains in a cave, near the Arctic Circle, 8 km north of Rovaniemi.

  

Now she is deciphering some mysterious letters containing information about some numbers that can lead her to the next target.

  

Lara has a document that contains a series of numbers that can be used to decipher them:

  

```

Symbol Target

. 1

, 5

: 10

; 50

! 100
```

| Symbol | Target |
|--|--|
| . | 1 |
| , | 5 |
| : | 10 |
| ; | 50 |
| ! | 100 |

  

Lara has also noticed one thing. Symbols are subtracted ***if they are immediately to the left of another major symbol.*** ðŸ˜±

We have to create a function that passes us a text string with symbols and we have to transform it to the correct number. Watch out! If you find a symbol that we don't understand, we better return a `NaN`:
```
decodeNumbers('...') // 3
decodeNumbers('.,') // 4 (5 - 1)
decodeNumbers(',.') // 6 (5 + 1)
decodeNumbers(',...') // 8 (5 + 3)
decodeNumbers('.........!') // 107 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 100)
decodeNumbers('.;') // 49 (50 - 1)
decodeNumbers('..,') // 5 (-1 + 1 + 5)
decodeNumbers('..,!') // 95 (1 - 1 - 5 + 100)
decodeNumbers('.;!') // 49 (-1 -50 + 100)
decodeNumbers('!!!') // 300
decodeNumbers(';!') // 50
decodeNumbers(';.W') // NaN
```
